ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project - "Amazon Clone"! ðŸŽ‰

I created a website that looks and works just like Amazon using HTML and CSS. It's a complete replica of Amazon's homepage, with a similar layout and features for browsing products.

ðŸ’¡ Key Features:

âœ… Product Showcase: Check out various products with images, and names, just like on Amazon.
âœ… Easy to Use: I focused on making the website user-friendly, so you'll find it familiar and intuitive.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used:
HTML | CSS

ðŸŽ“ Learning Experience:
Building this project taught me a lot about front-end development. I faced challenges and grew as a developer with each step.

ðŸ“¢ I'd love to hear your thoughts!
